<p>This setting determines the priority of this cluster's associated themes in determining which to use for a particular user.</p>
   
<p>For any particular user, the themes on all assigned clusters will be ranked based on this value, and the highest-priority
  theme will be used. Themes with higher priority should be assigned larger values than those with lower priority.</p>

<p>This setting should be used in conjunction with associating a theme to this cluster.</p>

<p>Please use distinct values whenever possible to avoid arbitrary prioritization.</p>
